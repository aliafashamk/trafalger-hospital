Project Title
Trafalgar Hospitals – Work and Leads Workflow Analysis Dashboard (Power BI Project)
________________________________________
Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital operational data from Trafalgar Hospitals to track bed occupancy, doctor workload distribution, patient diagnoses, and billing trends. The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive, interactive view of hospital performance, helping management improve resource allocation, patient care, and financial outcomes.

Data Description
•	Source: Trafalgar Hospitals dataset (Excel/CSV)
•	Key Columns:
o	Admit Date – Date of patient admission
o	Discharge Date – Date of patient discharge
o	Follow-up Date – Scheduled follow-up visit date
o	Bed Occupied – Type of bed used (Private, General, ICU)
o	Doctor – Attending doctor’s name
o	Diagnosis – Type of illness/injury diagnosed
o	Billing Amount – Total billed amount per patient
o	Health Insurance Amount – Covered amount via insurance
o	Month – For trend analysis of billing and insurance claims

Project Objectives
1.	Monitor hospital bed occupancy by type.
2.	Track workload distribution among doctors.
3.	Identify the most common patient diagnoses.
4.	Analyze monthly billing and health insurance trends.
5.	Support operational and financial decision-making.

Steps to Reproduce
1.	Load Data – Import Trafalgar Hospitals dataset into Power BI.
2.	Data Cleaning – Handle missing dates, correct column formats, and standardize diagnosis names.
3.	Data Modeling – Create relationships between patient records, doctors, and billing tables.
4.	KPI Creation – Use DAX to calculate:
o	Total Billing Amount
o	Total Bed Occupancy by category
o	Number of patients per doctor
o	Frequency of each diagnosis
5.	Visualization –
o	Bar Chart for Bed Occupancy (Private, General, ICU)
o	Donut Chart for Doctor Workload Distribution
o	Funnel Chart for Diagnosis Count
o	Line Chart for Monthly Billing & Insurance Trends
6.	Interactivity – Add slicers for date ranges and patient IDs for detailed analysis.

Key Insights

1. Bed Utilization: Private beds had the highest occupancy, followed by General wards and ICU.
2. Doctor Workload: Workload is evenly distributed across six doctors, each handling ~14% of patients.
3. Common Diagnoses: Viral infections and flu account for over 50% of total cases, followed by malaria and typhoid.
4. Financial Trends: Billing amount fluctuates across months, with peaks in January and December, suggesting seasonal illness patterns.
5. Insurance Coverage: A significant portion of billing is supported by health insurance, with variations by month.
